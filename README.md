# DnD Localized Functions
This project initially started because the DnD DM is a busy person with a lot of projects on his plate much like myself (well, really one big one not many small ones) and he can't spend all of his time with calculating DnD players moves. So, I decided to take it upon myself to implement it into a discord bot, however first I am localizing all of its functions so I know what to exactly implement into my discord bot.
## esolocalmovement.lua
This file generates a hexagonal grid, however represents it as a square grid for simplicity's sake. 
All a hexagonal grid really is, is a square grid; however, with a slightly different means of moving around. \
\
In the very near future I will implement a real grid generator instead of representing it like this.
## The Objective
By the finalization of this repo I wish to have released a full version of my DnD bot and with customization options 
later in the near future.
